  An app for iOS 14+ that allows users to store and view their characters, with (hopefully) useful tools for in-session use, such as health and condition tracking, modifiers for actions such as Raise Shield and more.
  This version is made using C# in .NET MAUI, since Swift is not exactly "user-friendly". Both repos will stay up for now, but I might deprecate the older one.

## Demo
<!-- Here is a working live demo :  https://iharsh234.github.io/WebApp/ -->


## Site

### Landing Page
Don't know yet when or if I will make it available on the App Store


## Mobile support
The WebApp is compatible with iPhones running iOS 15+. I have yet to test it on iPads, but hopefully it should work just fine out of the box.
